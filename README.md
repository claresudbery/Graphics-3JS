# Graphics 3JS

- This code was written in a workshop at Socrates UK '23, run by Tom W
- We followed instructions from [this page](https://github.com/SoCraTesUK/socrates-uk/wiki/3D-Graphics-with-3js#indexhtml)
- I've attempted to do a new commit for each small step
    - Looking at the commits might help to iron out any wrinkles
- NB: You can get enhanced IDE support (VS Code) if you follow [these instructions](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation)
    - ...but worth noting Tom didn't include this in the workshop, as you can manage without and it keeps everything super simple / removes the need to download anything
